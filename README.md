# Kaggle Excercises
stock-price-analysis:
- In this notebook I analyse stock market price data
- This helps to inform my understanding of the data I have and build my hypothesese
- I then use a keras tensorflow model to try and predict future stock price changes
- The ability of a model to do this is relatively limited, so the outcome of this work is incomplete
- But it has been a great learning excercise

Update Stock Data:
- this is webscraping code used in my market analysis work

Titanic Classification Submission:
- I could have improved this model by conducting hyperparameter tuning
- Or even building an ensemble model
- I scored 77% on the test data for this competition and displayed a good understanding of the task
- This meant I was in the top 250 with my submission, which is a really strong performance

House Price Regression Submission:
- In this task I was able to test cross validation, an ensemble method and conducted hyperparameter tuning 
- My model performance was strong against the evaluation data

Disaster Tweet NLP Classification:
- this was a good opportunity to process NLP data
- I used Sklearn's Pipeline package rather than building my own pipeline
- this allowed me to vectorise the data and train a model in one step, which will be useful for other model types when standardising/normalising
- I was in the top 500 with my submission, which I am really happy with
